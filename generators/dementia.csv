"Hi. It's obvious that we need some sort of a resource guide. I'd like to crowdsource this so feel free to post anything that has helped you. This will be curated, so please don't post anything that would seek to take advantage of our users or that would offer false hope. If it's some sort of alternative (meaning non-peer-reviewed) treatment, mark it as such. If your resource is specific to a region, please mark it as such. Most of this so far is based out of the US but the information is applicable for most.

Great practical solutions for taking care of people with dementia. thank you,"We have a little suite for my dad upstairs.

We put a baby gate at the top of the stairs so he couldn't fall down the stairs itmotn.

We have Wyze cameras up so we can check on him constantly

Alexa is great to program periodically through the day what day it is, time, the weather and I left a message of ""we love you PawPaw and you are at home with you're daughter""

Bed rails

Buck has these onesies that zip up the back so they can't take their clothes off. It stopped the problem of my dad peeing everywhere

Hospice has been helping us for over a year under the losing weight/wasting diagnosis

Things for their hands. I gave him Greek god wooden blocks he likes to hold and play with

Toilet seat raiser

I put pictures of his life everywhere in case he gets lost and doesn't know who he is. However they are out of reach

A soft wheelchair

Lots of fleece blankets as he gets super cold

Hormel has these vita juices and my Company delivers meals with vitamin enriched cookies. Look into if their insurance covers some meals

Contact the local Alzheimer's Assoc and if they still walk find a Pace center near you (we do the meals for the one here too but it's more than just a daycare)

He's having trouble swallowing now so we had to give him a spit dish (so gross) and remind him to swallow by running our hand down his neck and prompt him with eating

resources for dementia,"When a residents saddened visitor comes to me saying ""I wonder if I should even bother coming. They don't know who I am anymore"". I remind them that their visit is always of benefit. They may not recognize the person who is with them but they will definitely reap the benefits of that positive interaction. If their visit leaves the resident feeling uplifted and happy then that mood is quite often upheld long after the interaction has ended and they've forgotten anyone was ever there. The same applies to a negative interaction. If the visitor has said or done something to upset them then it can be very difficult to settle the resident, even long after the individual has left.

This video is one of the best I've come across to explain emotional memory in dementia and I recommend it to everyone.

I take my dad there tomorrow! And I‚Äôm so thankful to hear this!!!! He was diagnosed four years ago and it‚Äôs still a struggle as he doesn‚Äôt understand his illness (nor will he). So glad to hear this!,Thank you!
"It actually went really well, my dad is very similar it sounds like. What‚Äôs really nice is it‚Äôs not obvious when you go to the clinic that it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúAlzheimer‚Äôs‚Äù clinic, it‚Äôs fairly discreet.

After months of asking, what finally did the trick in getting him to get tested was him realizing on his own that his memory wasn‚Äôt working as well as it used to, along with some other health concerns. I framed it like ‚Äúwell wouldn‚Äôt it be a good idea to know what‚Äôs going on? So you can maybe get better meds and we can plan for the future?‚Äù And eventually with me asking nicely enough times it worked.

It was a fairly drawn out process, 2 in person appts and they required him to go to the hospital for an MRI and B12 panel. I honestly think the main reason he cooperated for so long was because he thought the neuroscientists testing him were cute. Whatever works, right? XD

Of course now that it‚Äôs been a few months he‚Äôs in denial about his diagnosis but I hear that‚Äôs very normal. I wish you the best on your journey and hope you get some answers soon üôèüèª","https://health.ucdavis.edu/alzheimers/

-------------------------------------

Have her bills sent to your address if she‚Äôs losing things. You would be the ‚Äúmailing address‚Äù not the ‚Äúresidential address‚Äù‚Äîthat would be where she lives, whether her house or a facility.

Create an email for HER (that only you control) for anything you have to email or receive for her. Keep it totally separate from your email for clarity and convenience.

Sign up on USPS for ‚ÄúINFORMED DELIVERY‚Äù for her, using the new email. This will let you know every day what mail is expected for her. You‚Äôll know if she‚Äôs losing mail in her house. Do the same for you. (I've simply had all her mail forwarded to my address)

Create a spreadsheet for her...life. You can have smaller subtables on one document, organized by subject: bank accounts, creditors, medical, identification, funeral, etc.

List ALL accounts: institution, account/routing/ balance phone number. This is for banks, CUs, retirements, etc. Same with creditors. You want ALL balances owed, closing dates, and due dates. You will likely be paying bills with her accounts, start tracking it all. If she has credit cards with high interest rates, call and ask if they can be reduced, or if the debt can be reduced.

Take pics of her ID, medical, SocSec cards and put them on the spreadsheet. You can get a extra SS card online. Likely medical cards too. Create an online profile on Social Security and get yourself listed as a Representative Payee, so you can talk to SS on her behalf.

Create online accounts for everything and include website address and login info in the right tables. Paying online under her name/account is much easier than writing checks.

You want every piece of information you may need to handle her life in this document. Keep adding and reorganizing as needed. This is for YOUR use, make it usable to you.

You control it through an online portal... you can set it to only send and receive calls from the contacts you enter (cuts out robo/scam calls) and each contact appears with either just a picture of the person or their name AND picture. The picture is big so they can see it easily.

From the portal you can see geo location, battery status, and also set the power button on the loved ones phone to never turn off (so they can't turn it off either on purpose or accidentally). There IS a 911 bar on the screen but you can buy the additional service that lets the 911 calls go to a screening service. It's $7.99/month or $80/year. They will know the person calling has dementia (or whatever other conditions you want them to know about) and will send the pre-determined contacts a text so they can help the loved one. If they think there is a real emergency, they will notify the contacts AND 911 :) This will often be helpful if the loved ones memory care unit/facility doesn't want them to have a phone... some are worried there will be a lot of ""fake"" 911 calls.

However, this is also peace of mind for us because it won't just go un-noticed that our loved one is distressed and give us chances to help them. In other words, no one at the place can cover it up..."

In a prospective study of 49 non-demented elderly individuals, higher dietary intake of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was associated with a faster rate of decline in memory during a 3-year follow-up period (p = 0.012 after adjustment for potential confounding variables). AGEs are compounds formed in some foods during harsh cook ing and processing. These compounds promote inflammation and may also accelerate the aging process. Methods of reducing AGE In double-blind trials, daily consumption of cocoa flavanols for 8 weeks significantly improved cognitive function in elderly individuals (mean age, 71 years) with mild cognitive impairment and in elderly individuals (mean age, 70 years) with normal cognitive function.3 Cocoa flavanols appeared to work in part by improving insulin sensitivity. The lowest effective dose of flavanols in these studies was 520 mg/ day. That dose would correspond to 80-560 g/day of dark chocolate, depending on the type of dark chocolate. Further research is needed to determine whether lower doses would be effective.

"If the grim reaper showed up for my dad today, I‚Äôd gladly invite him in and offer him coffee and a plate of cookies. The dementia is eroding my soul. I‚Äôm so tired of being a caretaker.","I hear you. I wish my dad could ‚Äúgo Home‚Äù as he begs. Not because I don‚Äôt love him or am tired of caring for him (although that is often true), but I am so sad to see him suffer. Outliving one‚Äôs brain is such a horrible way to exist."
"Absolutely! It's called the shrinking brain disease. We took care of dad for 2 1/2 years. We loved him, but it was a relief when he died. We did everything we could to keep him at home, it was rough. We would do it all over in a heartbeat. My brother gave remarks from the family at his funeral. He asked everyone in the church to stand and give our dad a standing ovation. He was a great man and well-loved in our community.","That‚Äôs the coolest thing ever. Goals, for real."
My mom is at that brief stage where she realizes what's happening to her (sometimes) and it's SO damn heart-breaking to see her in terror of losing herself. She wants it to be over already...It's damn cruel to make people live through dementia after most of who they are has already flown.,Agree. Maybe medical assisted suicide will become more socially acceptable for diseases like this. Once my brain and bowels are gone I‚Äôm pulling the plug.

Almost 12 years of watching her die from dementia and all the awful problems that went with it. Of course I cried and cried when she was taking her last breaths, but what was saddest of all was how a vibrant, active, intelligent woman slowly disappeared and became difficult, combative, incontinent (both ways), and faded away."
"If the grim reaper showed up for my dad today, I‚Äôd gladly invite him in and offer him coffee and a plate of cookies. The dementia is eroding my soul. I‚Äôm so tired of being a caretaker.",I completely understand this sentiment.

I try to get him to understand that with the stage she's in it could be another year or two. I'm her only caretaker, I'm so tired. I know we all are."
"My brother keeps thinking ‚Äúit won‚Äôt be long now‚Äù for our dad but he‚Äôs in decent physical health so actually, yah, it probably will be a long time and it makes me mad/sad.","Same here. All of his physicians comment on how well he‚Äôs doing physically. His great grandmother lived to be 95, and I don‚Äôt know if I can handle another 10 years of this. You and I will muddle through, but the bad days make this road so much longer."
"OP, I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm with you here, I really am.

I‚Äôll preface my post by saying that my mother was really difficult throughout my life‚Äîshe had her fleeting good, lively moments, but she was more often angry, sadistically unkind, and sometimes violent. She had horrible depression and self-medicated with alcohol. Anyhow, her dementia began after a series of mini-strokes in 2000. When my dad died, ten years ago, she went into an assisted living facility where we ended up shelling out extra for a private nursing team. We got panicky phone calls in the middle of the night, so we stepped up her care to 24-hours (on top of the AL costs). Eventually she made it to the top of the waiting list for a memory care facility. She‚Äôs getting the care she needs, but it is a dreadful, depressing place. She spends most of her time in bed now and generally refuses to answer her phone. Every so often, my brother calls me up (I live across the country) with the ‚Äúany day now‚Äù alarm, and out I come. By then she‚Äôs usually rallied, rallied meaning that she‚Äôs back in a wheelchair and saying that she wants to go back to bed. To all of you who are giving hands-on care, I salute you, and I acknowledge the privilege we have in having our mother in a safe place.

I haven‚Äôt had the sunniest relationship with my mother, but it fills my heart with sadness to see her being drip-fed oblivion by this disease. 22 YEARS. The woman is 93. My brother and I secretly long for the relief of ‚Äúthat call‚Äù. My husband, who is a real sweetheart, comes from a more traditional Eastern European background where you just don‚Äôt voice that kind of thing, so I keep it to myself.

So OP, I feel for you with all my heart. What you‚Äôre feeling is valid and utterly understandable. Sending you thoughts of strength.","Thank you for the kind words. I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through, and I completely understand the feelings behind ‚Äúgetting the call.‚Äù People who haven‚Äôt been through this don‚Äôt understand how emotionally exhausting it is watching someone you love become a petulant toddler. I wish you a peaceful heart."

We did get to talk once in a while, though, and when we did he was always the best listener and sounding board. That died long before he did. Sucked so hard to have him there but also so far away, so that any possibility of getting closer was erased."

My grandma raised me, and it‚Äôs been hard. I often think about what it would be like if this didn‚Äôt happen. shes only 76, which i know is not /young/ per say but I work with elderly who are much older than her and still functioning you know?

Or i think ab if I could teleport back in time. I have a lot of trouble recalling what she was like before but I‚Äôm not sure why- unless I think about teleporting back. (I feel my brain is protecting me from the feelings atm)

There are some days, far and few between now, where she‚Äôll recognize me suddenly and her face lights up and sometimes she‚Äôll start crying happily. She reaches out to me and wants to hug and kiss me and tell me she loves me and it‚Äôs the closest i‚Äôll get to the real her. It‚Äôs so bittersweet.

My mom uses the excuse that she worries about the lack of much of a lip on the shower (purposeful to eliminate trip and fall hazards) and getting the bathroom floor wet. We've explained over and over that the floor is linoleum and won't be harmed by water. She still uses it as an excuse not to shower.

We've decided we won't push it unless she's actually reeking. If it's just a few days without a shower, it's not worth getting her upset to push the issue.

A bath poncho made out of a sheet or towel. We'd slip it over his head while his clothes were still on and then undressed him. This stopped him from feeling cold/vulnerable.

Get the bathroom screaming hot and steamy, like steam room level stuff.

Have music playing. Weirdly, Jimmy Buffet for my dad. (Even though he never listened to him any other times)

A shower seat and handheld shower so the water didn't come down from above."

My aunts say older people don't need to shower as often as their skin will break down. One, a nurse, has suggested bed baths instead of a shower, but so far the shower is still working weekly for us.

What works for us, is when she's already in the bathroom to use the toilet, we move her into the shower. When we tried to ask her to get a shower, she would tell us she already had one or she would take one later. Already being in the bathroom was a big help and and she's half undressed usually. After she's done using the toilet, we move her to the shower chair, then move that into the shower enclosure. I, or someone, now have to sit in on the shower bench with her.

When it's time to get her out of the shower, I use a towel around her like a gait belt, and lift her to standing, turn and sit her in the wheelchair that is now facing the shower enclosure.

I'll tell her it's bath day and she'll usually say okay. Before, her excuses were she was either hungry or she was full, or she was cold. I think that it was too difficult for her to bathe herself, raising her arms to shampoo her hair, and other parts of her body. So now, she sits in the bath seat and I'll wash her while she holds the shower wand or the washcloth. I make sure the water is at the temperature she's comfortable with.

"esterday was Mom's birthday
She turned 82, and she had no idea it was her birthday or how old she is. She kept forgetting, and every time we gave her a card or she received a phone call with birthday wishes, we had to remind her that it was her special day.

I hate that I dreaded it. I'm so tired, depressed, and, anxious that I put in minimum effort. A card, a small cake, a couple of sets of PJ's. I hate that I was cranky with her when she insisted on spending every single minute with me - it's getting to the point where I have to hide in the bathroom AND SHE WILL STILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR while I'm in there. I need so much space from her and it felt shitty wanting it on her birthday.

The thing is, I'm pretty sure that this will either be her last birthday ever or, the last one that she will be even able to talk and understand anything said to her. Her decline is happening so quickly now I'm absolutely certain next year she'll be in skilled nursing because I can't do this much longer and I won't have the skillset needed to care for her.

Sorry for the word vomit, I know I'm all over the place, I just need to get it OUT. I hate my life right now, and I feel terrible complaining because it's so much worse for her, and all I can think about is how I wish I could have my life and sanity back.

She turned 82, and she had no idea it was her birthday or how old she is. She kept forgetting, and every time we gave her a card or she received a phone call with birthday wishes, we had to remind her that it was her special day.

I hate that I dreaded it. I'm so tired, depressed, and, anxious that I put in minimum effort. A card, a small cake, a couple of sets of PJ's. I hate that I was cranky with her when she insisted on spending every single minute with me - it's getting to the point where I have to hide in the bathroom AND SHE WILL STILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR while I'm in there. I need so much space from her and it felt shitty wanting it on her birthday.

The thing is, I'm pretty sure that this will either be her last birthday ever or, the last one that she will be even able to talk and understand anything said to her. Her decline is happening so quickly now I'm absolutely certain next year she'll be in skilled nursing because I can't do this much longer and I won't have the skillset needed to care for her.

Sorry for the word vomit, I know I'm all over the place, I just need to get it OUT. I hate my life right now, and I feel terrible complaining because it's so much worse for her, and all I can think about is how I wish I could have my life and sanity back.

Thanks for listening. I needed to vent. I'm glad I have therapy today.","I find those celebratory days hard, too. You did a good job. And yay for therapy. I believe it is essential because this disease is so hard."
"Dad with dementia can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt care for himself at home but miraculously recovers when doctors are watching.
I am so frustrated.

My dad (62M) has vascular dementia and is cared for solely by my mom (61F) in their home. They can‚Äôt afford in-home help (which their insurance barely pays for) or assisted living (which it won‚Äôt cover at all). Although he is incontinent, can‚Äôt take his meds on his own, falls regularly, and can‚Äôt independently shower or use the bathroom, he is deemed too independent for nursing-home-care coverage by their insurance or Medicaid.

He is currently in the hospital for sepsis, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, and an infected pressure sore. My mom has taken diligent care for him for almost a decade, but his condition has deteriorated, and it‚Äôs just too much for her now. We were both hoping this hospital stay would lead to rehab and eventual admission to a nursing home.

But my dad is showtiming and seems to have the ever-rotating cast of providers fooled. They even judged his ability to transfer from his wheelchair (he‚Äôs an amputee) to the toilet an 11 out of 13. But when he‚Äôs at home, he almost always falls doing that maneuver alone.

In the hospital, he‚Äôs claiming to have no nausea, no pain. But he‚Äôs done nothing but complain about nausea and abdominal pain for a week. And his test results support that.

They‚Äôre going to end up sending him home with her, aren‚Äôt they? She‚Äôs going to kill herself caring for him. I mean, he outweighs her by 50 pounds. This is madness.

This has happened before. In the hospital and rehab? I want to walk again! I want to wear my prosthesis!‚Äù Real life: I have literally never seen the man wear his prosthesis. Ever.","Every time he falls on the ground at home, call the fire department to pick him back up again. It will be annoying as heck but it will establish a record to pack up your claim that HE IS NOT SAFE LIVING AT HOME."

"Demented family member refuses medication and is very agressive. Please, help!
Hello, it‚Äôs my first time here and this will be quite a read. But I ask you kindly to help. We are at a loss.

I will start with all the basic information. We have a family member who suffers from dementia, she‚Äôs 88 years old, lives on her own, and in poor health. Mentally, atleast.

She goes out on her own, is in constant dispute with neighbours, calling the police 5x a day, getting into fights, getting lost, she is rude to us, screams at us, threatening us to leave her house. She‚Äôs very, very ill. And yet there is nothing we can do.

I am a nurse, I started noticing the symptoms a long time ago, and notifyed her doctor. But there is nothing we or they could do. They gave her medications, had the talk with her, so did I and my mom. We tried to get her to a psychologist, but she refuses to go anywhere, getting worse each day. She talks with herself most nights, we can‚Äôt sleep.

So now I am turning to you, reddit, I don‚Äôt know how to give her medication so she won‚Äôt notice because if she won‚Äôt take them, she will most likely go insane. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk to us and won‚Äôt listen. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. We also don‚Äôt share a kitchen so we can‚Äôt put it in her food. What else is there left to do?

Pain symptoms will definitely set off his temper so a pain treatment plan needs to be established. Pain is scary when you‚Äôre in a confused state like he is.

Psychiatric meds work too, but hopefully he‚Äôs got a doctor that knows what they‚Äôre doing.

I can‚Äôt stress how much his aggression is most likely caused by fear, anxiety and or pain. Being angry feels a lot better than feeling anxious hence why we switch into battle mode.

The other option is finding a memory care facility that specializes in caring for dementia patients if his current facility doesn't offer these services.

The main benefits of skilled nursing versus assisted living if they have it at minimum license practical nurses sometimes referred to as licensure occasional nurses or LPN/LVN and typically have a minimum of one registered nurse on duty. Personal care homes in assisted living facilities typically only have med techs and potentially an LPN. I was a med tech during nursing school and you literally get anywhere from one day to no more than two weeks of training. Very minimal. So unless there is a third-party like hospice involved providing for medication recommendations it‚Äôs very difficult for a personal care home or assisted-living to determine to what level of medication is effective or not. At least at a skilled nursing facility, if and I do repeat if the staff of skilled on reassessing the effective medication‚Äòs after being given versus just being so understaffed that they feel overwhelmed just getting out the med pass‚Ä¶, They can adjust the meds more accurately."

"After five years, sadness and relief
For five years, I and our children had been trying to get my wife to a doctor for her increasingly obvious cognitive problems.

We‚Äôll, as previously posted, the inevitable crisis happened and five days ago she (VERY unwillingly) entered a memory care facility. They do not want me to visit for about two weeks, and after two stressful phone calls, even those are out for the moment.

Sadness and relief‚Ä¶these years could have been somewhat better (especially since it‚Äôs vascular dementia), but that‚Äôs not who she is/was and that‚Äôs now history.

Hoping things will settle down and I can visit and even take her out for lunch, but clearly not yet.

So thankful that we bought Long Term Care insurance around 15 years ago. I don‚Äôt know how the next years would be without it.","I'm glad you were able to place her.

I really think people with dementia go through the stages of grief, conscious of it or not. My grandma went through something similar but at a faster rate. Luckily denial was the shorter phase and she sought diagnosis/treatment pretty early on. We are at year 9 of her diagnosis. Her anger lasted a year or 2.

Hopefully with some time she can fall into a routine and find happiness."

She has vascular dementia specifically. When she had expressed some memory concerns my Mom went with her and she got tested. It was a pretty slow decline until the last 4 years. She just finally got to the point that she started losing major skills. In the last 3 years my role in helping her has definitely increased. She does go to a senior day center 3 days a week. Which has been great for her and myself. And we are beginning at least a few hours of having in home care so I can do things without having to supervisor her as much.

Going nuts seems to be a part of the job. I helped a friend move to another state and that felt like vacation. :/"

It took about 8 months for her to finally settle in. At that point, she was thinking that she was still living in her apartment. She has now regressed to thinking my brother & I are small children. I hesitate to go see her, because I don't want to confuse her - imagine thinking your daughter is about 10 years old, and a 50 year old woman shows up saying she's your daughter. And my one biggest piece of advice that I've gotten from literally everyone from the facility staff, to her family doctor, to our neighbor who's mom had it - DON'T TAKE HER OUT. She will only get more confused & just might refuse to go back. I'm not sure how her facility works it, but at my mom's, if I wanted to have dinner with her, I just need to let them know and they will prep a dinner for me too for a small fee ( I think it's $10 or $15)."

The anger is gone now, for the most part. Short, more frequent visits seem to work the best. I tried to take her out for lunch or to visit at my house but the experience was too overwhelming- the dementia makes car rides terrifying as she thinks cars are coming too close, we are going to be hit, etc. So we just visit and I always have a small treat in hand to bring her- gifts brighten her day.

It should get better- but it‚Äôs dementia so things aren‚Äôt going to be amazing- but with time and a routine it will hopefully be more pleasant. My mom enjoys the music and the scheduled programs."

"
I know I am going to have to be 'bad cop' at some point soon and push / trick her in to getting medical attention i think. Just so we know whats going on. My FiL & husband never stood up to her about her refusal to seek any type of medical assistance. She used to be a very grumpy woman, so it was a lot easier to give up pushing than fight her on this stuff. The grumpiness has mellowed with onset as long as you don't upset her. My husband once tried to talk to her about her issues but she refuted everything and seemed genuinely distressed as to why he would make up such things.

She was primary carer for her mum who had diagnosed dementia, it sounds like her father had it too but he was gone before I became part of the family (25 years ago). Her twin sister has diagnosed dementia, and like i say, she clearly has it. My father in law was hiding from us just how bad it was (Not sure why as we where/are very active in their lives) and until FiL death she put on more of a front for us (didn't always manage it, but managed enough to hide just how bad it was).","I would suggest getting her eyes checked. Could this be cataracts?

"Should my dad have to ask for pain medication? Nursing home not giving pain meds after hip fracture unless he explicitly asks.

Today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn‚Äôt asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. I told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. The nurse said they give them when the patient asks.

They determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. Like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. So the excuse was they don‚Äôt want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks.

Does this seem right? Do I just not understand how this works? I‚Äôve never had a parent or any family member go through this so I may not understand.","Not a doctor/nurse but I work in an Assisted Living facility as the Activity Director. If the meds have been prescribed PRN or as needed, they won't give anything unless he asks. If you are his medical PoA, you can ask the doctor to change it to meds every X # of hours. The M.C. staff I've worked with have been attentive to our residents non verbal cues when it comes to pain and will bring it up to the nurse who then will try to get an answer from the resident (are you hurting?) in order to give PRN meds. You can ask to talk to the Director of Nursing at the facility to get a more detailed answer. Also, pain meds come in more forms than oral, some are creams, others are patches. Hope this helps"

Today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn‚Äôt asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. I told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. The nurse said they give them when the patient asks.

I‚Äôm not sure my dad understands to ask for pain meds. For context he comes across very lucid at times. You almost question his dementia diagnosis until you realize he thinks he is working at the nursing home not a resident. Then he talks about how they are holding his hostage and refusing to pay him and he can‚Äôt find his car. And he thinks he‚Äôs owed a paycheck from a place he hasn‚Äôt worked for in 40 years. It‚Äôs strange. He has also forgotten he has a brother and sister. I‚Äôm not convinced he understands to ask for and can make a connection between pain meds and pain. Also worth noting the palliative care team got involved because he was very combative both physically and verbally prior to his hip fracture and refusing to take meds. They determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. Like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. So the excuse was they don‚Äôt want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks.

Does this seem right? Do I just not understand how this works? I‚Äôve never had a parent or any family member go through this so I may not understand.","As a specialty visiting nurse visiting patients wherever they live including at facilities I find that PRN medication‚Äôs, those which need to be asked for, are not regularly given, regularly assessed in the correct way by the nursing staff and if you have somebody who has dementia like symptoms it‚Äôs not going to ask for them. So depending on the situation and family desires, I typically write A recommendation to give XYZ mad at X frequency as well as have a PRN dose for breakthrough.

Please consider talking with the doctor or nurse practitioner or a physicians assistant as to prescribing routine pain medication as well as having a PRN dose available for breakthrough pain."
"Should my dad have to ask for pain medication? Nursing home not giving pain meds after hip fracture unless he explicitly asks.
Last week my dad fell out of bed at his nursing home and badly broke his hip. He had surgery placing a rod, screws and a plate, was in the icu for a week and sent back to his nursing home.

I will talk to them about having them prescribed at regular intervals instead of prn. Not sure if it‚Äôs possible but I‚Äôll try. Thank you all!

How often do you visit AL?
My mom is in AL for a few weeks now. She has moderate dementia, with moments if lucidity but she‚Äôs not really self sufficient. The facility is good but sometimes when I come trash has built up, things aren‚Äôt in their place (she has a tendency to pull things from her closet and put them around her room), non trash things are in the trash, the tv remote is lost, etc‚Ä¶ and I have to spend some time ‚Äúresetting‚Äù everything to a good state. She hasn‚Äôt taken advantage of AL facility activities, just hangs in her room watching tv. She seems relatively content but the longer I stay away the more disoriented she seems to get and the more calls I get from her about things she can‚Äôt figure out that she forgets she can ask staff about (like tv, temperature).

I‚Äôve been visiting daily but it doesn‚Äôt feel sustainable. That said, I‚Äôm not seeing how I could be away for too many days. Was hoping to learn more about how others approach these situations.","I visit 4 to 6 times a week. It‚Äôs getting a bit exhausting, so I might try to stick to 4. My advice to you would be to try if you can to have some sort of schedule. I generally arrive after dinner and stay approximately one hour. We sit in the same place and talk about the same things. The routine aspect of it helps I think. But then she might expect me on the days I don‚Äôt go (even if I told her the day before), because of that routine that is in place. In the end, I think that the important part is to find a balance. Something that works in your schedule and that is consistent enough to not disorient her."
"NYC support group for parents/family with early-onset dementia
Does anyone know of any support groups in the NYC area for children of people with dementia? My dad has early-onset dementia of some kind. It's still in its relatively early stages and he does not have a specific diagnosis yet, but it has been tragic to see. Looking online, I see some groups in the area for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's. I'm not sure a group like this would be right for me though because I don't live with my dad and he is still fully independent, although impaired in noticeable ways. Any tips or advice would be really appreciated...",In CA and not answering your question directly but I'm in a similar situation with my mother. I've been trying to get her to do a living will and power of attorney so that I or someone can figure out her financials and get her medical in order but it's been wildly difficult. There's crazy legalities when they get to a certain lack of basic abilities and your ability to protect them (and them protect themselves) a POA and LW will keeo what they want written in stone.

"Grandmother refuses to seek diagnosis for possible early-stage dementia and it is causing division in my family
My grandmother is 75. She has been experiencing short-term memory loss that I and several of my family members believe is indicative of dementia. I'll try to list a few examples off the top of my head:

She asks the same questions repeatedly in a conversation even when we've answered them several times

She wakes up in the middle of night wondering where she is and sometimes asking ""how to get home""

She struggles with numbers; for example she has difficulty handling money and remembering information like birthdays and phone numbers` (I know that's relatively normal but she never had issues with that before)

She expresses concern about me walking outside alone because I'm a ""little girl."" I'm 18 years old. I should point out that she did not mean that figuratively or humorously. She often speaks to me in an infantilising way and I have heard her asking my father how old I am on several occasions

Recently, my father went to visit her in her city. He went out with his brother and their cousin and while they were out he expressed concern about these symptoms. He told them about my great-grandmother (from my mother's side of the family) who died of dementia. By the time she died, she was confined to her bed, had very limited speech, and could only remember a select few people and everyday objects. The cousin, upon hearing this, relayed it to my grandmother, and basically told her that, if it's dementia, she needed to seek help in the early stages or else she would end up like my great-grandmother earlier than was necessary.

My grandmother was absolutely enraged by this. She said that she was not 'crazy' or mentally ill. We tried to explain to her that it's not about that, but she absolutely doesn't care. She has flat out refused to even consider that it could be dementia or to see a doctor about any of her symptoms. She seems genuinely insulted by the idea and won't accept it. She has now stopped talking to my dad's cousin. It's been several weeks and it doesn't seem that they've had any contact.

I am becoming increasingly worried. I don't know what to make of any of it.

EDIT: Sorry, I should mention that I am in the UK but grandmother is in Greece",If you are in the U.S. contact your local area on aging. From what you describe she‚Äôs not really early stages. I learned with my mother that she was able to hide issues from us for years. It really wasn‚Äôt found out until we realized she no longer did things like cook or bathe bills were seriously behind. But she still drove and insisted she was fine. It wasn‚Äôt until I asked her to cook my favorite meal. She had a complete meltdown and was very evident she didn‚Äôt even know how to turn the stove on anymore. So call the local area on aging for what ever area you are in.

EDIT: Sorry, I should mention that I am in the UK but grandmother is in Greece","That's actually pretty typical. My mom never actually admitted to having a problem. The one time we tried holding that conversation with her, she grabbed her meds and literally ran to her bedroom and was stuffing clothing into a grocery bag, ranting about how she was going to run away from home and the only one she was talking with her was her dog because he didn't think she was crazy. I think on some level she realized there was a problem and she knew from her mom and grandma's show decline that she was going to end up the same way. After that, we just did what we had to and operated on the ""easier to ask for forgiveness than get permission"" system for dealing with issues she wasn't going to like."

EDIT: Sorry, I should mention that I am in the UK but grandmother is in Greece",I feel for you and your family. This was my wife for five years. I was always told by professionals and others that only a crisis would result in help. Three weeks ago it did and five days ago she entered a memory care facility. What a waste of what could have been better years. Keep trying to get her to a doctor and be evaluated - the next years can be a struggle or teamwork. Good luck.

EDIT: Sorry, I should mention that I am in the UK but grandmother is in Greece","I'm not convinced diagnosis is essential. Must admit I'm fairly new to dealing with it in the family, so no expert. And I do understand that there are some medications that may help certain types of dementia, but if the loved one is resisting, and its early stages, I'm not sure its worth the distress. it feels to me like they need to be able to trust people around them during this very confusing and scary stage, so if they take against you / your dad, its going to make things more and more difficult.

We've found that doctors will talk to us anyway without a diagnosis. I rang MiL surgery and explained and they put a note on her file and said now a doctor will discuss certain stuff with me. We later persuaded MiL to allow us to be 'added' to her file. We rang the doctors, explained to her it would help with us being able to take jobs off her shoulders, then put her on the line to agree they could talk to us about more stuff. The doctors have now said we can book appointments to get her assessed when she is ready, or we think we can manage it, and we can book other stuff on her behalf and report concerns, request appointments. we haven't actually used this yet.

Later on obviously more support may be needed so we may need an official diagnosis, I don't know.

Social services let me handle everything for her. She now has carers pop in once a day to do a welfare check (more for our peace of mind than her needs) and a few other minor services etc. All the relevant pension and benefit agencies let me register as her proxy, after sending a letter to her address saying it had been requested (giving her a chance to object, which she didn't). so the UK seems quite well set up for family to be able to support in early stages without an official diagnosis.

I do wonder why your cousin told her what had been said. If they were trying to be helpful / open with her, it may be best for your dad to try to discuss / agree a way to handle the situation. Most family dealing with dementia I've come across agree that you are best to avoid confronting the suffer with the topic without good reason (I.e don't correct them when they think its Friday on a Tuesday etc) (it only causes embarrassment and distress) and gentle correcting on other stuff, not making it out to be a big deal.

If the cousin did it to sh!t-stir- hmmmm. be careful. maybe speed up your dad getting registered as the one to talk to at the doctors / proxy with benefits etc. Talk to other family to agree a way forward. but don't fight in front of her."

I think he‚Äôs on something called memantine as it worked better alongside others he has to take like anti psychotics and anti depressants etc,"It is always try and error with medicine. I tried memantine for my mom several times. You usually start with 5 mg and add 5 mg each week until you reach 20mg. Every time my mom reached 10mg her agitation and aggression got worse. Choosing between two evils I chose not to give her memantine. But I try every several months. She is on antidepressant and 2 antipsychotics in very small doses. One is helping with delusions another helps her with night sleep.

Mom's doctor prescribed the antipsychotic which finally made the delusions sort of bearable after almost 3 years' attempts to manage the condition with less strong drugs. He prescribed it after I told him, the stress of constant accusations and hysterics is killing her caregivers. Her energy levels amaze him. He told, she would still have delusions, as nothing really eliminates them, but the intensity of her emotions will decrease. ""My 83 y.o. husband is bringing prostitutes in every night and pays them with my slippers and bras...bastard...has always been...what is this noise from the yard?"". This instead of hours of non-stop emotional fight and even physical abuse.

I know others who stopped giving the drug for reasons very similar to mine. You shall try it. You can always stop.

But my question is how quickly have people seen dementia advance from this stage?","It varies for everyone. Sometimes better healthcare and activities can help slow it down. Sometimes it doesn't.

Unfortunately, dementia runs in my father's side of the family. His oldest brother ""Bob"" had it around 2008 and died in 2016. His younger sister ""Sara"" was diagnosed 2013, her husband, my Uncle ""James"" was diagnosed like in 2018. my father was diagnosed 2015. My father was doing good for awhile, till he became resistant to take his meds from my stepmother. And my space cadet of stepmother was afraid of crushing his meds and putting it in his food. Later on, we got a better handle of giving him his medication. My father had moments where he seemed he was getting better. His dementia got bad in winter 2020 and died in 2021. My Uncle James died later in 2021. My aunt Sara is still alive and walking, she recognizes her kids and grandchildren, but is all over the place in her dialogue. So it's different for everyone.

My Uncle James was diagnosed a few years after my father. My Uncle James had better healthcare (had a general practioner & specialist for the dementia) then my father and had an aide, plus went to day programs. He ended up dying months after my dad. My dad didn't go to the doctors as much because my younger half brother got him a doctor extremely far from home. We were only seeing a general practioner, no specialist. My father had no home aide and adult day programs. My Uncle James stopped talked for a year or two before he died. My father was talking till the night he died. My dad still remembered names of his siblings, children, ex wife, and wife. So my cousins did everything they could do for their father and he died pretty quickly, while their mother is still alive and had the same treatment her husband had and got dementia before her husband.

My Uncle Bob who died in 2016, stayed pretty lucid for a long time. I didn't even know he had dementia till like the last 3 years of his life. In the end, he couldn't talk and walk anymore, and wouldn't eat. They had to tube feed him through the nose.

So I'm saying all this to say with every dementia patient it is different. I have heard people deteriorate like a few months after diagnosis and die 3 years later. While others get diagnosed and have a very slow mild systems for like 7 years, then gets worse by 10th year and die like 15 years after being diagnosed."

He doesn‚Äôt seem to bad at the moment because his medication is helping, he is forgetful and confused sometimes when he talks about things. But my question is how quickly have people seen dementia advance from this stage?","Just be advised that Alzheimer‚Äôs medications can actually worsen symptoms. I have seen it happen to my dad, MIL, 2 aunts, and it happened recently to a friend that became nauseous, dizzy, and emotionally unstable after starting Aricept. She stopped taking it after 1 week and finally 2 weeks later she has greatly improved. Side effects of these medications can actually be mistaken for disease progression."

Mom was diagnosed at the end of 2019, and I read that most people are diagnosed at mid-stage. She's now in late mid-stage, which seems really fast. She's incontinent of urine, can't clean herself after any bathroom visits, and is starting to lose her words.

There is also some stats out there with estimated durations of each phase of Alzheimer's that can give you a loose timeframe.

"Is there treatment for dementia? Can dementia be slowed down?
I have recognized some changes in my mom who is nearly 70. These changes are mainly in mood and aggression over slight things. There is some senselessness too. Memory loss and confusion is not a big issue. It's very mild and hardly noticable. The biggest issues that I see is mood and easily angered, and senselessness.

It's only recently when I am piecing a lot of these issues together and I think she is going senile. I have suspicions of maybe dementia but my biggest issue here is that it's not presenting with a major loss of memory and confusion that you would associate with dementia and Alzheimers. Every day is different with her.

I am actually seriously thinking that maybe dementia might be coming in. It's early days yet.

I'm at a point where I don't know how to proceed. I know she won't be open to me having a chat with her. She won't welcome that and I think it will be met with hostility from her. We do attend the same GP practice so I am thinking about chatting to a GP at my next appointment and give her my suspicions of the possibility of dementia and tell her what I am saying her. Memory loss is limited and not an issue or a huge concern of mine. It's other things presenting - mood, personality, aggression, some senselessness there's even a type of ocd setting in. She never had ocd when I was younger.

My question here is - Is there treatment for dementia? Can the progression of dementia be slowed down?

If this is the case, It would be worth my while raising my concerns now with a doctor instead of waiting some years and seeing more serious symptoms of memory loss, confusion and losing the ability to perhaps care for herself. If the progression of the condition can be slowed down, I think that would help her and me too.",Can't stop it they can slow it down not to be a downer but it's all down hill from here there are treatments in testing sounds great but nothing for the now enjoy your time while you have it

Then today she knocks on my door and asked if i liked the pizza. I was like you asked me this yesterday, and she didn't remember.

Sometimes she forgets the curling iron is on but that's more rare, though it does happen. I find it weird how a very cautious person could forget such a thing. My cousin works with her and i asked if she has trouble forgettinf words ans events at work. She's like ""that's just the meningitis"".

"Hi. New here. I have a question.
Thank you in advance for reading this.

There has been no dementia in our family. Everyone lives into their late 80's or early 90's, and almost everyone dies of a fall, although my maternal grandpa died at 88yrs of diabetes.

My mom is 89yrs, and all the way up til December she was normal. She could tell you every single detail of every single day, she had no trouble with word finding, we would talk regularly and laugh about our 2 soap operas that we watch.

But then she got a UTI @ Christmas. She wasn't getting over it, it was during that time that my niece visited her. Mom didn't recognize her, that frightened her because my niece visited her all the time.

My niece called my sister, who drove over and saw mom. Mom thought my sister was her mother.

Everyone @ the nursing home said oh, it's the UTI. We accepted that, but it's been months now that she's gotten over the UTI, and she's not getting better mentally. She's getting worse. She's hallucinating now, and when I visited her recently she thought i was an employee @ the nursing home.

I tried calling her, the aide answered, she said your mother didn't know how to answer her phone. She handed mom the phone, but mom put the phone in her lap and just sat there. The aide said your mother doesn't understand where your voice is coming from.

The doctor doesn't have her on any medication for dementia. We've been waiting for 2wks for him to get back to us to explain wtf is going on with her.

Here's my question. I understand people with dementia get UTI's, and that UTI's exacerbates dementia symptoms, but what if someone was normal before the UTI? Could it be that she has a rare form of RPD?

Thank you to anyone who responds.",Someone should take her to a doctor for a proper workup and then to a neurologist. It's possible that this is a quickly progressing form of dementia but it's also possible that it's something treatable.

Does he or she know your mother, seen her regularly, know what ""normal"" looks like for mom?

I've seen with my own parents how profit-centered their ""independent living + attached intensive care unit"" was. The doc may not be up to something bad, but may certainly have a bias to retaining her as long as possible. Personally, I'd at least make no decisions without a second and possibly third opinion‚Äîregular doc, and then if warranted, neurologist."

From what we were told, the doctor visits the patients once a week.

We have zero life experience with nursing homes, so my sister figured not hearing from the doctor for a couple of weeks was normal.

Mom went into the nursing home last year because she fell a couple of times at my sister's house. The last time she hurt her shoulder.

I'm this close to going over to the facility, and telling them to tell the doctor that if he doesn't call us, we'll call Medicare and report him for not giving our mother medications for her obvious delirium/dementia."

Janitors, food servers, IT department‚Ä¶ Politely, but with a small undertone of ""if you mess up, you will be hearing from me, as will many other people.""

In my experience, treating dementia is more than just giving medications. You've got to know what kind of dementia, and what other problems or interactions may be caused by dementia meds. (Alzheimer's Association, https://www.alz.org/, can give you a fuller rundown).

You might get an appointment with this phantom doc, or at least a phone call, maybe give him a deadline. Or possibly one of the nurses higher up on the food chain in management. (Nurses may have a schedule that allows an appointment earlier, and may have more of a grip on your mom's situation.)"

I actually got into an argument with my MIL's doctor that she was ""safer"" in the wheelchair than walking. In spite of all my best efforts, she quickly lost her mobility and I blame the fact that the residence is penalized by Medicare for falls. An outside doctor really is your best advocate."

"Hi. New here. I have a question.
Thank you in advance for reading this.

There has been no dementia in our family. Everyone lives into their late 80's or early 90's, and almost everyone dies of a fall, although my maternal grandpa died at 88yrs of diabetes.

My mom is 89yrs, and all the way up til December she was normal. She could tell you every single detail of every single day, she had no trouble with word finding, we would talk regularly and laugh about our 2 soap operas that we watch.

But then she got a UTI @ Christmas. She wasn't getting over it, it was during that time that my niece visited her. Mom didn't recognize her, that frightened her because my niece visited her all the time.

My niece called my sister, who drove over and saw mom. Mom thought my sister was her mother.

Everyone @ the nursing home said oh, it's the UTI. We accepted that, but it's been months now that she's gotten over the UTI, and she's not getting better mentally. She's getting worse. She's hallucinating now, and when I visited her recently she thought i was an employee @ the nursing home.

I tried calling her, the aide answered, she said your mother didn't know how to answer her phone. She handed mom the phone, but mom put the phone in her lap and just sat there. The aide said your mother doesn't understand where your voice is coming from.

The doctor doesn't have her on any medication for dementia. We've been waiting for 2wks for him to get back to us to explain wtf is going on with her.

My friend (then 80) had lifelong cognitive issues, and was about 14 mentally, so when she breathlessly told people there was a zebra running down the hall so she didn‚Äôt go to her volunteer placement, she wasn‚Äôt taken very seriously. Later she told me her she stopped going into her livingroom because the porcelain dolls were talking to her and it was too scary.

Once fixed she was fine, kept independence, and lived another 15 years dementia-free. Just a little different as always - in ways she‚Äôd been her whole life.

Our dad died from dementia in June. Five of us, well 4 1/2 took care of him at home for 2 1/2 years. We talked to his primary doctor, who took exceptional care of our dad, and explained he would ""sundown"" pretty bad after dark. He did the walking around with his coat on, waiting for his ride to go to work or church. He held business meetings or prayer meetings, all at night, which kept us up. He prescribed a low dose Ativan 0.5, for him to sleep and us too. We still slept with one eye open, just in case(we still do out of habit). It worked out well for us.

Maybe next appointment bring it up with her doctor? Caregiver burn out is real. We rotated in and out every 4-5 days. When I left, I came home, showered then slept for 12 hours"

"No more weekend naps for me
My mother is suffering from LBD. She usually gets a lot of aimless energy in the middle of the day. She walks back and forth, moving things, talking to hallucinations, opening doors, ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù, etc. Most of the time I‚Äôm at work when she gets this way, but during the weekend, I‚Äôm home and usually keep an eye on her so she doesn‚Äôt get into anything too dangerous. This helps give my dad a break. I used to indulge in wonderful, cozy weekend naps on the couch that I looked forward to all week. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. Her dementia has slowly become worse and she requires more attention from caregivers now. If I take a nap on the couch, i have one eye open. I am still paying attention to my mom and have to listen to her marching back and forth for hours, so I can‚Äôt take my naps anymore. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish. It‚Äôs just interesting and sad how dementia subtly and drastically alters every day life for everyone involved.","I'm going through the same right now, except she does the wandering all night as well. I'm lucky to catch more than an hour of sleep most nights and try to take quick cat naps when she does in the day. I feel your pain and I'm so sorry"

When you are setting the appt, you can ask them to note her chart for the Dr and for the appointment reminder. That may or may not get overlooked but it‚Äôs worth a try so they know what‚Äôs going on if she tries to cancel instead of confirm. Do your grandparents go to the same Dr?

I agree too that the easiest way may be to just make the appointment, take her and tell her something like the doctor‚Äôs office made the appointment, insurance requires it, etc. Therapeutic lying goes a long way with this disease.

Also, if you can, email the doctor beforehand and detail all the things you are concerned about. Or write a letter requesting it be placed in her medical record.

This year: Now she very rarely will know she needs to toilet and sometimes doesn't even realize she is soiled.

Before that, she was a resident in a local hospital until the govt found her a place in the aged care facility. That's where she is until I could travel (we live in diff continents). We facetime chat twice a week and I could see the changes during these conversations. In less than 3 months after moving to the facility, she lost all her mobility (thanks to the understaffed clinic). She has had a series of falls (5 last year and 2 this year <and counting>). I've seen her hallucinates, her episodes of sundowns, her deliriums, her rashes and scabies, her weight loss...

All these changes I've journaled and shown on her youtube dementia channel. You can check her out here:

Though no two people are similar, I cannot tell how fast and what changes your loved one could decline. Depending in what type of dementia and other health condition she has may be helpful in estimating her dementia stage and life expectancy.

One thing I could tell is there is never a time when I don't feel like crying..it hurts to see them struggling. We tend to see our struggles as carers (it's Hell) but it helps me by reminding myself that she is all alone, navigating what little life she has with her dementia. And that she is slowly dying. So, I'm packing up and will travel in a few weeks to care and be with her.

It will be long goodbye.

Thank you for posting. Take care of yourself, as carer, we need even for a few hours, time for ourselves."
"I need advice from those who have been here.
I am caregiver to a family member. She is forgetful and often can‚Äôt repeat what she just said. Sometimes yes is really no and no can be yes, you just to have to figure it out. She doesn‚Äôt want to bathe or wash her hair. It is difficult to get her to drink enough water which leads to constipation. She recognizes her grandchildren but has trouble recalling their names. On the dementia F.A.S.T. scale she seems to land into level 6, but not all of the way in. I understand she will need to be in level 7 before hospice will help. I think when the test results come back she will be diagnosed with vascular dementia. I know no two people will deteriorate at the same rate or in exactly the same pattern, but could you give me some idea of what to expect and how long the stages will last before the next level. Thank you for reading my frazzled description.","Our dad had dementia, we were never told what type he had. We planned to rotate in and out to take care of him, we just didn‚Äôt know when. He walked out the door locking the screen door behind him in subzero weather. A neighbor saw him pried the door open and called me, we moved in that night. It was 2 1/2 years we took care of him round the clock. His appetite was good, he just kept loosing weight. His kidney function went down, his PSA was high, his primary said he probably had cancer. He gave us a hospice referral and daddy went on hospice 04/28/2021 and died June 5th. The last three weeks he just slept and refused to eat or drink which is common with dementia patients."

He's seems to be declining at a monthly rate imo and if I had to put say what stage he's at then I'd say 6. He can not communicate with sentences that make sense,he is now fully incontinent and refuses to be cleaned mostly, he now argues with the tv so I play music or cartoons and I have to coax him to eat or drink sense his appetite had decreased. Some new things happening also is he can no longer tie his shoes which he knew how to a month ago and he's beginning to hate leaving his chair. Its such awfully slow process and depressing to watch a loved one wither away in this manner. I'm not sure what the next few months will look like let alone the rest of this year. I'm sorry you and you're loved one are going through this. I wish there was an actual time frame or scale to figure out how long this suffering lasts."

"Looking for a GPS/tracking watch for my parent with dementia.
My family has been watching my father progress with dementia for years now. He's got good days, and bad days. More often good minutes and bad minutes these days. He doesn't drive anywhere or do much, but sometimes he's sneaky and will get up and start walking away while someone is either in the bathroom or kitchen. He doesn't have a phone anymore because the ringer just made him scared or upset.

He's recently been asking for a watch and my family is trying to find something that not only tells time but they can also live track location on GPS in the off chance he ever walks off or figures out the locks. Does anyone have any recommendations for a good GPS watch for an elderly parent with dementia?

My mom would like something that could call too, but I don't think he'd understand the calling piece of a watch. The GPS piece feels like the most important.

Thank you in advance.","Look into something called AngelSense. It is not a watch but a gps device. Originally created for kids with autism, it also works great for wandering dementia adults. We had this for my dad and he was able to walk his dog independently for probably an extra 9 months."

We have it attached to their purse, but if she consistently only wore one set of shoes we‚Äôd have hid them in there. Being on the purse also makes it easy to find when she misplaces it.

Why we went this route is batteries. Most active GPS things have a day or so of charge. At that point you‚Äôre hoping someone in the house remembers to charge it."

"but I'm only 30...

The other day I was getting ready for a work function and I paced around my house for a good hour because I kept forgetting where I was in the process. Did I need to grab pants? My keys? Socks? Basic things I kept getting lost with. I've also sat in the car for about 5 minutes because I forgot how to reverse and, most recently, I went on a walk around our neighborhood that we've lived in for almost 6 years now and got lost. I ended up 4 miles away. Even my dog was limping. I had been gone for hours...but I thought it was only 20 minutes. My fiance had to use the tracking on my phone to find me. These are just what I can remember, I feel like there's way more.",This also sounds like my husband at times. He‚Äôs 29 and has bad anxiety and adhd. It could also be disassociation. Are you on any pills that would cause side effects? I also agree that it‚Äôs unprofessional for a GP to give you this diagnosis. There should be so many other things ruled out before that. Have you talked to the doctor about this for a while? Or just bring it up at an appointment and then were told it was dementia?

I do have significant anxiety and PTSD, but I'm on medication that helps with that, and that I've been on well before these symptoms showed up. I know what dissociation and panic attacks are like because I've had them, but this is different. I'm not panicked or paranoid so much as in a general fog of confusion, that just doesn't go away. It's almost like I find out something ""new"" every day almost and am constantly having breakthroughs or learning something new that I already knew. Lol"

I'm wondering if it's possible you've had a TBI (traumatic brain injury). Some of the long-term symptoms of TBI can overlap with dementia symptoms. A neurologist should be able to help you make a distinction.

Instead they said that they needed further testing. They also carried out blood work to rule out other conditions that can mimic dementia before the referral.

The relatives had a battery of testing plus scans before any diagnosis took place. One relative looked like a classic case of Alzheimer's - very elderly and forgetful. Turned out she'd developed a rare neurological condition instead.

Conditions that need specialist tests can't be diagnosed in a GP's office. The GP may suspect a diagnosis, but they can't be certain without the test results. Similarly even a neurologist can't diagnose without testing.

If I'd been given a ¬£1 for every medic who decided my relative had Alzheimer's on meeting them I'd be going on holiday with the money.

As a family carer, one thing I've learnt is to wait for a definite diagnosis before worrying. Yes, I know, it's easier said than done!"

A neurology consult is good as they will likely roll their eyes at this referral and deduce you do not have a neurodegenerative disease.

99.99% of cases in your age range are cognitive deficits as a result of severe stress, anxiety, depression, ADD, other psych disorders, etc.

I think it's pretty unacceptable that your( I assume) primary care physician would even say the word dementia to a 30-year-old. This is what caused you to go speak with your fiance and friend about this supposed dementia and very very likely caused unnecessary and undue worry for you and your family. I would recommend finding another primary care physician, to be honest.

While I cannot definitively say you don't have dementia, the likelihood is so infinitismal that no one should be saying those words to you without the proper training and education and testing completed.

The fact that your grandmother had dementia does not correlate to inheriting dementia in yourr 30s at all. Late on set dementia with a genetic component causes late onset dementia on offspring. Not a super early onset.

I noticed in another reply you stated you have had declining issues since 2014. Any true neurodegenerative disease starting 8 years ago and in your mid twenties would have progressed so rapidly that you probably should have been dead for the past 3 years.

The symptoms that you describe in your other replies really seem more based in a psychiatric realm. Things like not remembering how to go in reverse for 5 minutes is not a typical symptom of dementia. It is probably either a psychiatric issue or seizures.

I'm sorry you have been hit with this. Even I am upset at this preposterous premature diagnosis and I'm not even involved :/. Please proceed with the neurology visit and share with them as much as you can remember. I also recommend again to find a new PCP."

First, let me say I'm so sorry for your loss.

I'm also extremely sorry that you are in position where you feel very alone.

My grandparents are two of the most important people in my life. They always have been.

Thankfully, I have other family members who feel similar.

However, I totally get what you're saying about many other people.

I've witnessed how many friends and coworkers have dealt/responded with the deaths of their own grandparents or offered condolences to others.

There's a lot of, ""Well its sad, but they were old, you know?"" attitude. An idea of just quickly moving on.

But when the time comes for both of my grandparents, who are 90, I truly feel like I will be completely devastated for MONTHS.

This may not be the time, but I'd consider reevaluating your relationship with your partner, given her response (especially after reading your other reply here).

Please remember that your grandmother loved you, and she knew that you loved her too.

I'm sorry again for your loss."

Have you used Headspace before? They have a meditation course on grief and it's been so helpful to me dealing with my Nana's dementia. Either way, many states have a warm- or support line you might be able to call in to get the support you deserve."

my grandfather has dementia and due to a recent stroke, his whole left side cant move thus making him not mobile he also cants control his bladder and often wets the bed. We put him on diapers but he would always pull it off with his working hand causing it to spill on the bed.Right now we all are trying to help around the house and care for my grandfather but whenever he has to move or anything my dad is the one to carry him and he's been doing this the whole day not to mention he's also working full time so he has his hands full. We want to help carry him and all but my grandfather is quite heavy to the point where even three people (me, mom, and grandma) cant carry him thus only relying on him. i feel bad for him he's so tired and can barely catch a break he nearly fainted several times. I don't think we can keep doing this forever and when he is at work I don't know how we will carry him. Were thinking of getting a maid but not a nurse or anything due to the cost but I don't know to what extent the maid can help.

"My Friday Funny
This happened last night and I'm still laughing about it.

My wife, in 4th stage dementia, is still pretty lucid most of the time.

She went to bed at her usual 10:30 ish. Around 11 she walked into the living room and asked me if I would take her to Target tomorrow to get a new bed sheet. Well, yeah. Good night.

I went to bed at my usual 12:30 ish.

At about 2 am she wakes me up and says the phone just talked and said ""Turn left in a quarter mile.""

I did not hear this and we both agreed it was probably a dream.

About 2 hours later I hear. ""Make a U-turn in 1000 feet.""

I looked at her phone and she had mapped directions to Target but didn't shut it down.

I'm not sure how to finish this up, but hoping y'all get a laugh out of it too.",That's pretty funny! Matching up a little confusion with a little technology that's almost too smart for its own good.

"How did you convince your loved one with dementia to go to a doctor and get tested for dementia?
I am In a very complicated situation my landlord's mother has some type of mental Illness I think that it is dementia but I am not sure because I am not a psychologist or a doctor. I know that she has some type of mental illness because when her daughter aka my landlord dropped her off at my house I noticed that she had some strange behavior she would leave food on the stove walk away forget that it's there until it is burned, she mopped our floors with shampoo and conditioner, and she bought plants from home Depot put them in the sink with our dirty dishes and said that she was recycling the water.

I don't know if my landlord is in denial or if she does not want to deal with her mother. But my landlord has dropped her mother off at my house and forced me and my roommate to watch her mother two times. Every time I try to talk to her about her mother In a calm professional manner she either ignores me or gives me an excuse. I don't know what to do about this situation I tried talking to a lawyer about this and they said that because I am renting a room in a house I cannot stop her mother from coming onto the property.

I don't know what to do about this situation I am thinking about calling adult protective services on my landlord. Because I think that my landlord is abusing her mother by dropping her off at our place and forcing us to watch her when she knows that me and my roommate have no mental health training or experience, we have no idea how to take care of her mother and we do not have the time to watch her mother. But she still chose to drop her mom off here. I think that is very irresponsible and shows that she has poor judgement.

I know for a fact that her mother is going to accidentally hurt herself or someone else if she does not get the help that she needs. I know for a fact that the law says that if you are a danger to yourself and other people you have to go to a mental health facility. I am worried that if her mother does not get the help that she needs she is going to hurt someone or herself and if that happens she is going to have a cop and a social worker knock on her mother's door and force her to go a mental health hospital. If that happens my landlord is not going to have a single say over where she goes.

My mother had me much later in life, I am 33. So he and my sister are much older than me. I live abroad, so I don‚Äôt see her as much as my sister.

My mother has been over the last few years getting more and more frail and confused. We can be having a conversation as a group when she zones out and just blurts out something unrelated that she was thinking about.

My sister has been going through menopause (we think) and has gotten very bad over the last 6 years, unbearably horrible. Mood swings, depression, anger, frustration, gas lighting.

I visited home and met them both, and couldn‚Äôt believe how badly my sister was talking to my mother. Staring her down (bullying) and talking down to her like an idiot, then shouting/snapping at her everything she did or said, making her flustered.

My mother had me much later in life, I am 33. So he and my sister are much older than me. I live abroad, so I don‚Äôt see her as much as my sister.

My mother has been over the last few years getting more and more frail and confused. We can be having a conversation as a group when she zones out and just blurts out something unrelated that she was thinking about.

My sister has been going through menopause (we think) and has gotten very bad over the last 6 years, unbearably horrible. Mood swings, depression, anger, frustration, gas lighting.

I visited home and met them both, and couldn‚Äôt believe how badly my sister was talking to my mother. Staring her down (bullying) and talking down to her like an idiot, then shouting/snapping at her everything she did or said, making her flustered.

I am a nurse in dementia care. Dementia is a slow process that can speed up when swine becomes bed bound, so you could be right, however with older adults UTI and infection cause delirium. You can research it but delirium is basically acute confusion in older adults caused by infection that can be reversed.

Get her to a doctor, if it's not an infection then you know it's dementia, because with delirium since it is reversible we don't want to humor them, we try to tell them where they are to reorientant them, but with dementia, the diesease is processive so we just go along with it."

"Wanderer in the facility getting into bed with Mom
My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"". It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night.

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control.

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room.

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room? I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA.",Your mother isn't the problem resident.

"Wanderer in the facility getting into bed with Mom
My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"". It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night.

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control.

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room.

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room? I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA.","You actually should make a big deal of this, both for your mom's safety and the man's. The main purpose of a care facility is to keep the residents safe. Wandering such as this means someone is remiss, which is not safe for anyone. How established in this facility that they don't already have measures ready to address this, which should've been a consideration on their part from the very beginning?"

"Advice for parent who refuses help ?

"How old is your mother?
","She is 72

She is 72,"Okay. My mother is much younger but similar situation where she sees things and whatnot. I would first become her power of medical and financial. This will allow you to see her medical information as well as help make medical/financial decisions for her. It will make future decisions much easier for you as her dimentia progresses. Also, apply for disability. You must do these two things before even looking into options for your mother's care.

As for help, here are some options.

Move her into a care facility. Make sure to tour it and see what the atmosphere is like and whether or not you want your mother to live there.

Pay for at home care. This usually is very costly and may be difficult to find where you live. It may not even be an option.

Have home care come watch your mother certain times of the day while you are not with her. By the sounds of the stages your mother is at, she should not be alone and have someone with her 24/7

Drop your mother off at a daycare facility. Some care facilities offer watching people while you are at work or need away for certain times of the day."

"Can dementia change your political beliefs?
My grandma has Lewy-body dementia and recently moved to memory care. She‚Äôs always been somewhat moderate to conservative. Voted republican more often than not in the last 20 or 30 years, but is still a registered Democrat because she never got around to updating it.

But more than just what her voting habits were, she has always had a strong conviction that politics are personal. She gets offended when canvassers come to her door to ask who she‚Äôs voting for ‚Äî not because of the annoyance of the door knock, but because how dare they ask such an invasive question. To her, politics are a private thing you only talk about with trusted people.

We‚Äôve always been close, and Ive always been interested in politics and vocal about my own politics, and when she was mentally well we would discuss things occasionally. And still, all these years later, the above info is just about all I could tell you about her politics. Most people in her life have no idea if or how she votes at all. Any comments she‚Äôd ever make about politicians were decidedly not political ‚Äî she felt sympathy watching Biden speak about his son, she respected John McCain for his service. That kind of thing. Surface level, polite, personal, not inflammatory, nothing to do with policy or party.

All of that background to explain: she suddenly has a LOT to say and it‚Äôs kind of weirding me out. She hates Kamala Harris, apparently. That came out of nowhere. But ever since a few weeks ago, every time Harris is on screen she has a snarky comment, and today while Justice Brown Jackson was making her speech, grandma was yelling at the TV that she better watch out because Kamala was gonna get her for taking up the spotlight.

She has newfound very strong opinions about our mayor, too, who is so incredibly moderate and milquetoast that I didn‚Äôt realize anyone could have strong opinions on him. She has decided she dislikes a handful of anchors and pundits too, and dramatically rolls her eyes and makes little comments anytime they‚Äôre on the screen. Like a teenager!

I wish she didn‚Äôt like watching the news so much otherwise I‚Äôd turn it off, but she insists on having it on all the time. It‚Äôs often on mute and I‚Äôm not sure she notices that, it doesn‚Äôt stop her from making her comments. She‚Äôs not hurting anyone, and I don‚Äôt argue with her, so she can hate whoever she wants I guess. But it‚Äôs just so weird because she was never like this before. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar?","Dementia patients often lose critical thinking as the condition progresses, yes. They more easily fall for emotional pleas (common in certain political circles) and find it harder to follow or understand more difficult concepts. IMO this is part of why scamming old people is such a big market; tell a 50-year-old widow that you can speak to her husband as a psychic and she'll probably laugh you off (or curse at you). Tell an 80-year-old the same and a surprising number can be suckered in."

Tell an 80-year-old the same and a surprising number can be suckered in.","I think you've hit the nail on the head. Loss of critical thinking skills is a real issue, and I think it's one many of us are unprepared for, because it's just so foreign to us that someone might watch TV and believe everything they're saying, including in the commercials.

u/armadillorevolution, while your mom enjoys watching news, maybe it's time to start monitoring what she watches more closely - and not just because of the opinions she may be picking up, but very much because of the commercials. If she's exposed to commercials that are trying to raise funds - especially if they're using emotional appeals - or where you can purchase something immediately and by phone, she's going to be calling with her credit card in hand faster than you can change the channel. Even if you take away her credit card, she's going to be distressed by the fact that she's being called to take an action and she can't take it.

It's also worth being aware that conflicts of any kind seem to become magnified with dementia, and more and more distressing. She is probably genuinely upset by what she's seeing, which may also make her act out more. My mother used to read the Times every morning and listen to news radio all day, but we ended up censoring and eventually just stopping that because any time there was bad news (which, come on, was all day every day), it affected her mood so negatively, and she'd obsess over it all day.

Add to that the fact that Lewy Body can cause hallucinations that make it extremely difficult to tell the difference between a person in a photo / on TV and a person actually in the room with you, and you're facing a recipe for disaster. My mother (she has Lewy Body) thinks the people on TV are speaking directly to her, that she knows them and they're her friends. This is why we've basically limited her TV to nature documentaries and the lovely folks at the Great British Baking Show, since Prue Leith isn't going to foment conflict or hit my mom up for a donation!"

","I'll remain hopeful for you and her that she doesn't become combative cause not every person with dementia gets that way. Imo I believe its fear and confusion of their ever changing perspective of their surroundings that causes the aggression. It is almost impossible to understand life from their point of view. If she does exhibit any sudden change of behavior then it might be worth checking to see if she has a uti or any sort of pain.

I could make friends easy, had a gf, had a job, was super productive and was steadily progressing in life, Now I can barely think. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever recover from this and I‚Äôm done trying. Through the past 6-12 months I‚Äôve put in real effort in improving and have made zero progress. My life is nothing but constant anxiety and dysphoria. I feel like I have dementia. I‚Äôm constantly tired but can never sleep. I have headaches and random pains throughout my body, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I‚Äôm riddled with cancer. I desperately want to end my life but I have a massive family and suicide unfortunately only affects other people. The discomfort is becoming overwhelming. I‚Äôm paranoid and stuck in my head. I‚Äôve had nothing but my own repetitive thoughts to think about. I‚Äôve been living alone in a single room for years now. People in prison are punished with a life style like my own. I‚Äôm completely exhausted with life.","Actually your ‚Äúanswer‚Äù is in your ‚ÄúTITLE‚Äù...... deteriorating mental health!! Sounds like you need a Psychiatrist who can really help you with this! There are some great medications out there that can really help you feel good again. All those years of drug abuse affects your mental health in a huge way! I‚Äôm not a saint and have been through some hard times with drugs as well. I‚Äôm an ex international model whose seen the dark side of the business...! Trust me on this and please start with a mental health counsellor perhaps. Sounds like severe depression perhaps. The hard part is making that first step!!! But once you do, you‚Äôll be thankful..!!!

"Bringing my grandmother home.
Hello I am new here. Last summer my grandmother had a major stroke that caused brain damage resulting in dementia. Last month she suffered a cold and went severely down hill. Crazy what a cold can do to an old person I guess. Anyway, she can barely walk or talk now and moves very slowly. I was afraid to take her home in the beginning because she was causing shenanigans and was generally very angry. I am hoping to get a 6 month prognosis and get her on hospice. I am a stay at home mom with a 6 month old. I will not have any help from family. And if anything, very little help professionally. I feel like my grandmother will die soon, because of her recent and fast decline. Shes on lots of meds that make her sleepy, I think about taking her off them to see if she gets better but I am afraid to. Any tips and encouragement? I have a meeting on the 12th with the nursing home.","I think you should really think about that first instinct you had because you might find it enlightening. Caring for a person with dementia is beyond a full-time job. I don't know that's a good burden for someone already caring for an infant.

There's no shame in saying ""I can't be a good parent and a good dementia caregiver."""

So I could be wrong.,"Our dad had dementia and myself and 4 siblings took care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years round the clock at his home. It was demanding and we would rotate out after 5 days. The last six months were brutal. He went in hospice care April 28th and died June 5th. We had a bath aid twice a week and the nurses came twice a week. We could have had more visits but we learned how to change a hospital bed with him in it. He was already in diapers so we learned out to change them out with him in the bed. We already knew how to wash him up in the bed. It was exhausting and time consuming. We still sleep with one eye open. What I‚Äôve shared doesn‚Äôt reflect the actual day to day care. Our dad became our ‚Äúchild‚Äù. Think long and hard before you bring her home. Respectfully it‚Äôs way way harder than you think

Edit to add: his primary doctor managed his care until he went on hospice, who then stopped all meds other than low dose Ativan, until he started sleeping all the time at the end. Daddy would ‚Äúsundown‚Äù and get agitated at night, the Ativan helped him sleep so we could"
I feel like maybe it won't be so bad because neither her or my baby can move around freely. But I also have no idea what its like taking care of an elderly adult. So I could be wrong.,"Well, the baby's progress is likely to follow a predictable path. The thing about dementia is that you can't predict what may happen, or for that matter how long she will live. I don't think you'll want to have both a rambunctious toddler and a lady capable of shenanigans (even if that seems like it was confined to the past) on your hands at the same time.

Even if both are relatively immobile and sweet-tempered, you may have issues‚Äîfor instance, toddler in the bathtub, grandma starts yelling. Or worse, gets a sudden burst of energy and bolts for the front door. Or toddler starts running a fever and you need a run to the ER. Knock on wood, it won't happen.

As u/BossLady311 points out, medications can worsen brainfog. If you work with a prescriber to titrate down one at a time, even slowly and carefully, you may still have unexpected changes.

Personally, I'd have some form of extra help lined up if you start this dual caring role alone, and it seems to work now. That way, if grandma has additional needs, you're prepared to move fast."

For example, people with dementia often develop disrupted sleep patterns. Imagine finally getting a sick baby to sleep hours after bed time only to find out grandma is still wide awake when she stars yelling because her dying brain is telling her there's something to yell about and she doesn't remember there's a baby in the house. Who do you soothe first?

Or, at some point incontinence will become an issue. Imagine it's feeding time for the baby, but grandma soils herself. You go to help her clean and change--because she can't remember how to do it herself--but her dying brain tells her this is terrifying and she resists your help. Shit gets everywhere--a five minute job has just become a half hour or more of emotional management, bathing, and cleaning--and Baby is still screaming in the background for food. Whose needs do you meet first?"
"I feel like maybe it won't be so bad because neither her or my baby can move around freely. But I also have no idea what its like taking care of an elderly adult. So I could be wrong.
","I think this is a bad idea, unfortunately. You seem very kind. But you should prioritize your baby. A dementia patient may not sleep at night, might need your attention literally 24/7, might be incontinent, might be violent and abusive, might be hard to handle physically (I caught a dementia patient who suddenly fell with no warning at work 3 years ago - I still have shoulder problems) ... honestly you should not feel bad for placing her in care."
"I feel like maybe it won't be so bad because neither her or my baby can move around freely. But I also have no idea what its like taking care of an elderly adult. So I could be wrong.
","An adult weighs at least 10 times of an infant. It‚Äôs more when they actually push back against you instead of cooperate. When my grandmother was on hospice, in her final days we needed 2 people (1 strong man) minimum, 3 ideally, to change her diaper. 2 to physically lift her weight and grab/hand supplies. 1 to actually do the wiping and changing."

"An analogy
You're driving along a country highway, going 50mph, no problems, it's a nice day, and then --

You come around a curve and there's a farmer's tractor going 10mph. You brake, you downshift, whatever, no danger of a crash, you're just forced to slow all the way down to his speed. You don't hate him, you don't grudge him, you're just stuck behind him while he putters along.

Every time he gets to a four-way stop, he looks to the left and he looks to the right, and it takes him a minute to decide he can keep puttering along forward. At 10mph.

You're starting to get a little annoyed, and frustrated. After all, nothing against the farmer, but you've got places to be, things to do. You didn't set out to crawl along at 10mph. This isn't your speed.

But it'll take as long as it takes. No way to speed things up. A test of patience.

It‚Äôs part of extremely basic first aid such as the Heimlich maneuver. EMS can take 15 minutes to an hour for some geographic locations and if somebody is truly choking on food most likely will have died by then or even worse being a situation that any recovery will mean that the person will have severe deficits above and beyond what they may have now.

In terms of the textures of food and liquids. In the medical profession we refer to food as being regular texture if you can eat anything without having modifications done to the way the food is prepared.

A lot of times we have the equivalent of mechanical soft if we‚Äôre eating softer foods that are in smaller bite-size portions. The next texture is pur√©e where the food is put through a food processor to turn it into a pudding like thickness almost like mashed potatoes but just slightly thicker.

It sounds like he should be on hospice care at this point, or at least evaluated. If hospice does not take him then they can get you some resources.

A soup that has a broth and chunks of stuff in it are difficult for a compromised person to manage because the person has to contain the liquid in the mouth while chewing the solid pieces. With old people and people with dementia, what often happens is the liquid will slip down the throat on its own, without the person actually swallowing, and that's what causes the coughing/choking. Other ""mixed consistencies"" to avoid are things like very juicy fruits - for the same reason.

But I don‚Äôt know what to do, my parents are leaving me alone with him more and more (we all work but now it‚Äôs getting pretty drastic to leave him alone). If he chokes and it gets stuck in his air ways the only thing I could do is call 911 and I honestly don‚Äôt know if they would come fast enough. It‚Äôs really morbid but it is reality.

His eating has been on and off. Sometimes the refusal of food and sometimes he wants breakfast, lunch and dinner. Which I assume is the dementia, but he won‚Äôt want soup all the time. And he is very picky. Do I just make him shakes and smoothies when he‚Äôs home with me? I worry about his health if he eats candy and ice cream for all meals (He would probably love that lol) any suggestions or tips would be very helpful.","We have my great aunt ensure nutrition shakes. You can get them at most stores in the US. We got her the chocolate ones because she started really only wanting sweet stuff at the end and we told her it was chocolate milk. I am so you and your family are going through this.

A proper diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs vs FTD vs LBD, etc. would help determine that. It sounds like a swallow study may be appropriate. His PCP could order this or neurologist if he sees one. It could be a different condition causing this problem as well.

","Unfortunately he will never get an actual diagnosis. I do know there is dementia, but there‚Äôs something else going on as well

Some people need thickened fluid or different textures.
