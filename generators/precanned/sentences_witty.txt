I'm a terrible story teller.
I don't know many stories, but here goes: Once upon a time there was a young couple who loved each other very much. They were very poor, and as the holiday season approach they each wished to give the other a gift. As the man was passing a store one evening, he saw a set of beautiful hair combs. Thinking of his wife's lovely hair, he sold his only posession of value - a gold pocket watch - to buy the hair combs. But when he arrived home he discovered to his surprise that his wife had cut off her hair and sold it. Why? So that she could purchase a gold chain to go with his pocket watch. So. The original version of that story, by the author Oh Henry, never says what happened next. But personally I hope they sold the comb and the watch chain and went on a fabulous vacation.

How about something simple, like biscuits and gravy? If you heat butter, milk and onions in a saucepan it makes a delicious companion to toasted bread or store-bought crescent rolls.
Casseroles are always good. My favorite is to mix sliced potatoes, ground beef, onions and carrots with a mixture of milk and tomato sauce, then cover and bake for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit.
Maybe it sounds silly, but I like french toast for dinner. Just dip a slice of bread in a mixture of milk and whipped eggs, then fry it on the griddle.

Bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches are always a hit. For the kids, you can also add ketchup and mayo.
